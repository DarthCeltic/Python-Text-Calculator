# Python_text_calculator
This is a python script that was created whilst I was learning about if/elif/else statments and generic Python3.
Since creating, a number of users have contributed to the code(see contributors.md). This has helped give me a better understanding of the Python Language. 
This is great. I cleaned it up and gave some more streamlined processes to the different files. I do hope I dont offend. The calculator now has factorial, and the volume and area py files integrated and cleaned up.- DarthCeltic85
